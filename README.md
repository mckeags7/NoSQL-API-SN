This is an API build for the backend of a social network that uses a MongoDB, Express.js for routing, Mongoose ODM, and the moment package.

## Acceptance Criteria:

GIVEN a social network API

THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
